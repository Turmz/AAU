//ASSIGNMENT
//Systems.
//        A system is a hexagonal region of space that contains planets and ships. A
//        system has up to six neighboring systems. A system may have less than six neighbors if
//        it is on the outer rim. We can identify the neighbors by their position: We have a system
//        to the north, to the north-east, to the south-east, to the south, to the south-west, and
//        nally to the north-west. A system has between zero and three planets. The planets in a
//        system never change. Ships, on the other hand, may enter and leave a system. Figure 1
//        shows an example of a Galaxy with systems and planets (ships not shown).
//
//        Problem 5. Write a class to represent a system. Add an appropriate constructor and
//        methods for ships to enter and leave the system. Add a method to retrieve all the ships
//        currently in the system.
