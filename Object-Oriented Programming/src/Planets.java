//ASSIGNMENT
//Planets
//        A planet has a name and a resource production. Examples of planets are:
//        Velnor, Mirage, Perimeter, Vega Minor, Vega Major, Hope's End, Rigel II, and Industrex.
//        A planet can produce between zero and six resources.
//
//        Problem 4. Write a class to represent a planet.
